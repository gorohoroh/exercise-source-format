# Compare things

> For readers at home: this part is covered in the [Python Basics: Comparisons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bzxqIKYgf4) video.

A big part of programming involves comparing things. What's the easiest thing to compare? Numbers! Let's see how that works:

```bash
>>> 5 > 2
True
>>> 3 < 1
False
>>> 5 > 2 * 2
True
>>> 1 == 1
True
>>> 5 != 2
True
>>> len([1, 2, 3]) > len([4, 5])
True
```

We gave Python some numbers to compare. As you can see, not only can Python compare numbers, but it can also compare values of mathematical expressions like `2 * 2` and function results like the `2` returned by `len([4, 5])`. Nice, huh?

Do you wonder why we put two equal signs `==` next to each other to compare if numbers are equal? We use a single `=` for assigning values to variables. You always, __always__ need to put two of them – `==` – if you want to check if things are equal to each other. We can also state that things are unequal to each other. For that, we use the symbol `!=`, as shown in the example above.

Give Python two more tasks:

```bash
>>> 6 >= 12 / 2
True
>>> 3 <= 2
False
```

We've seen `>` and `<`, but what do `>=` and `<=` mean? Read them like this:

- x `>` y means: x is greater than y
- x `<` y means: x is less than y
- x `<=` y means: x is less than or equal to y
- x `>=` y means: x is greater than or equal to y

Awesome! Wanna do one more? Try this:

```bash
>>> 6 > 2 and 2 < 3
True
>>> 3 > 2 and 2 < 1
False
>>> 3 > 2 or 2 < 1
True
```

You can give Python as many numbers to compare as you want, and it will give you an answer! Pretty smart, right?

- __and__ – if you use the `and` operator, both comparisons have to be True in order for the whole command to be True
- __or__ – if you use the `or` operator, only one of the comparisons has to be True in order for the whole command to be True

Have you heard of the expression "comparing apples to oranges"? Let's try the Python equivalent:

```bash
>>> 1 > 'django'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
```

Here you see that just like in the expression, Python is not able to compare a number (`int`) and a string (`str`).
Instead, it shows a **TypeError** and tells us the two types can't be compared together.
