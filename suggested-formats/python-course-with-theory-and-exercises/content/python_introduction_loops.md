# Loops

> For readers at home: this part is covered in the [Python Basics: For Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEA6Rc86HF0) video.

This is the last part already. That was quick, right? :)

Programmers don't like to repeat themselves. Programming is all about automating things, so we don't want to greet every person by their name manually, right? That's where loops come in handy.

Still remember lists? Let's do a list of girls:

```python
girls = ['Rachel', 'Monica', 'Phoebe', 'Ola', 'You']
```

We want to greet all of them by their name. We have the `hi` function to do that, so let's use it in a loop:

```python
for name in girls:
```

The `for` statement behaves similarly to the `if` statement; code below both of these need to be indented four spaces.

Here is the full code that will be in the file:

```python
def hi(name):
    print('Hi ' + name + '!')

girls = ['Rachel', 'Monica', 'Phoebe', 'Ola', 'You']
for name in girls:
    hi(name)
    print('Next girl')
```

And when we run it:

```bash
$ python3 python_intro.py
Hi Rachel!
Next girl
Hi Monica!
Next girl
Hi Phoebe!
Next girl
Hi Ola!
Next girl
Hi You!
Next girl
```

As you can see, everything you put inside a `for` statement with an indent will be repeated for every element of the list `girls`.

You can also use `for` on numbers using the `range` function:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Which would print:

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
```

`range` is a function that creates a list of numbers following one after the other (these numbers are provided by you as parameters).

Note that the second of these two numbers is not included in the list that is output by Python (meaning `range(1, 6)` counts from 1 to 5, but does not include the number 6). That is because "range" is half-open, and by that we mean it includes the first value, but not the last.
