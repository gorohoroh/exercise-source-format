# Comments

Comments are lines beginning with `#`. You can write whatever you want after the `#` and Python will ignore it. Comments can make your code easier for other people to understand.

Let's see how that looks:

{% filename %}python_intro.py{% endfilename %}
```python
# Change the volume if it's too loud or too quiet
if volume < 20 or volume > 80:
    volume = 50
    print("That's better!")
```

You don't need to write a comment for every line of code, but they are useful for explaining why your code is doing something, or providing a summary when it's doing something complex.
