# If … elif … else

Lots of things in code should be executed only when given conditions are met. That's why Python has something called __if statements__.

Replace the code in your **python_intro.py** file with this:

{% filename %}python_intro.py{% endfilename %}
```python
if 3 > 2:
```

If we were to save and run this, we'd see an error like this:

```bash
$ python3 python_intro.py
File "python_intro.py", line 2
         ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

Python expects us to give further instructions to it which are executed if the condition `3 > 2` turns out to be true (or `True` for that matter). Let’s try to make Python print “It works!”. Change your code in your **python_intro.py** file to this:

{% filename %}python_intro.py{% endfilename %}
```python
if 3 > 2:
    print('It works!')
```

Notice how we've indented the next line of code by 4 spaces? We need to do this so Python knows what code to run if the result is true. You can do one space, but nearly all Python programmers do 4 to make things look neat. A single Tab will also count as 4 spaces as long as your text editor is set to do so. When you made your choice, don't change it! If you already indented with 4 spaces, make any future indentation with 4 spaces, too - otherwise you may run into problems.

Save it and give it another run:

```bash
$ python3 python_intro.py
It works!
```

Note: Remember that on Windows, 'python3' is not recognized as a command. From now on, replace 'python3' with 'python' to execute the file.

### What if a condition isn't True?

In previous examples, code was executed only when the conditions were True. But Python also has `elif` and `else` statements:

{% filename %}python_intro.py{% endfilename %}
```python
if 5 > 2:
    print('5 is indeed greater than 2')
else:
    print('5 is not greater than 2')
```

When this is run it will print out:

```bash
$ python3 python_intro.py
5 is indeed greater than 2
```

If 2 were a greater number than 5, then the second command would be executed. Let's see how `elif` works:

{% filename %}python_intro.py{% endfilename %}
```python
name = 'Sonja'
if name == 'Ola':
    print('Hey Ola!')
elif name == 'Sonja':
    print('Hey Sonja!')
else:
    print('Hey anonymous!')
```

and executed:

```bash
$ python3 python_intro.py
Hey Sonja!
```

See what happened there? `elif` lets you add extra conditions that run if the previous conditions fail.

You can add as many `elif` statements as you like after your initial `if` statement. For example:

{% filename %}python_intro.py{% endfilename %}
```python
volume = 57
if volume < 20:
    print("It's kinda quiet.")
elif 20 <= volume < 40:
    print("It's nice for background music")
elif 40 <= volume < 60:
    print("Perfect, I can hear all the details")
elif 60 <= volume < 80:
    print("Nice for parties")
elif 80 <= volume < 100:
    print("A bit loud!")
else:
    print("My ears are hurting! :(")
```

Python runs through each test in sequence and prints:

```bash
$ python3 python_intro.py
Perfect, I can hear all the details
```
