# Your first Python command!

After running the Python command, the prompt changed to `>>>`. For us this means that for now we may only use commands in the Python language. You don't have to type in `>>>` – Python will do that for you.

If you want to exit the Python console at any point, type `exit()` or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Z` for Windows and `Ctrl + D` for Mac/Linux. Then you won't see `>>>` any longer.

For now, we don't want to exit the Python console. We want to learn more about it. Let's start by typing some math, like `2 + 3` and hitting `enter`.

```bash
>>> 2 + 3
5
```

Nice! See how the answer popped out? Python knows math! You could try other commands like:

- `4 * 5`
- `5 - 1`
- `40 / 2`

To perform exponential calculation, say 2 to the power 3, we type:
```bash
>>> 2 ** 3
8
```

Have fun with this for a little while and then get back here. :)

As you can see, Python is a great calculator. If you're wondering what else you can do…
