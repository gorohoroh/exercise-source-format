# Boolean

Incidentally, you just learned about a new type of object in Python. It's called __Boolean__.

There are only two Boolean objects:
- True
- False

But for Python to understand this, you need to always write it as 'True' (first letter uppercase, with the rest of the letters lowercased). __true, TRUE, and tRUE won't work â€“ only True is correct.__ (The same applies to 'False' as well.)

Booleans can be variables, too! See here:

```bash
>>> a = True
>>> a
True
```

You can also do it this way:

```bash
>>> a = 2 > 5
>>> a
False
```

Practice and have fun with Booleans by trying to run the following commands:

- `True and True`
- `False and True`
- `True or 1 == 1`
- `1 != 2`

Congrats! Booleans are one of the coolest features in programming, and you just learned how to use them!
