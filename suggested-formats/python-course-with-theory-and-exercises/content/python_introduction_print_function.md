# The print function

Try this:

```bash
>>> name = 'Maria'
>>> name
'Maria'
>>> print(name)
Maria
```

When you just type `name`, the Python interpreter responds with the string *representation* of the variable 'name', which is the letters M-a-r-i-a, surrounded by single quotes, ''. When you say `print(name)`, Python will "print" the contents of the variable to the screen, without the quotes, which is neater.

As we'll see later, `print()` is also useful when we want to print things from inside functions, or when we want to print things on multiple lines.
