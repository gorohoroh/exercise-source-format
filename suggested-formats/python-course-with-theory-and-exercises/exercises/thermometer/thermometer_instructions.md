# Thermometer

Let's practice what you've learnt earlier when we discussed `if`, `else` and `elif` (collectively called _conditional statements_), as well as writing your own functions.

Let's write a function that, given the current temperature (in degrees Celsius) will write how we feel about this temperature.

The initial code in the code editor contains the following:

1. The definition of the `thermometer` function that only contains a line that says `pass`. `pass` is a way to tell Python that although the function exists, it doesn't do anything useful right now.
2. A call of the `thermometer` function where we pass `25` (meaning "25 degrees Celsius") as an argument.

Here's what you'll need to do:

## Instructions

### 1
Let's make our `thermometer` function do something. Instead of `pass`, add an `if` condition that prints "Too hot" if temperature is 30 degrees or higher.

```python
```

:::tests
thermometer_tests_1.py
:::

:::hint

This is what your code is expected to be after this instruction:
```python
def thermometer(temp):
    if temp >= 30:
        print("Too hot")


thermometer(25)
```
:::


### 2
Blabla:

```python
