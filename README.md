TODO:
* [x] Split exercise into 2 instructions
* [x] Try the same approach with Python
* [x] Try the same approach with JavaScript
* [ ] Address issues: naming conventions to define different kinds of files (examples, initial, tests) will be hard to maintain because of language-specific conventions (i.e. title case for files in C# and lowercase in Python and JavaScript; special meaning for dot in file names in Python, etc.)
* [ ] Try the updated approach with Kotlin
* [ ] Try the updated approach with Java
* [ ] Try the updated approach with multi-file exercises in C# (ASP.NET Core?)
* [ ] Try the updated approach with multi-file exercises in Java (take a template from Codeboard)
* Should each C# exercise be a separate project?
